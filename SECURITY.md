# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a research/experimental project. Security fixes are handled on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue with exploit details.

Instead:
1. Open a draft issue with minimal details **or**
2. Contact the maintainer privately (add your preferred contact in this file after publishing).

When reporting, include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected OS / Python version
- Any logs or stack traces (sanitize personal data)

Thank you!
